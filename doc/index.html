<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</DIV>
<P>Gimp Palettes is an addon for <A HREF="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</A> 2.81 to
allow easy use of colours from <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</A> palette (.gpl) files.
Material definitions in a 3D package like Blender are much more complex than a mere colour
specification; nevertheless, this addon can be useful for making use of standardized colours
for materials.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Installation"></A>Installation</DIV>
<P>To install Gimp Palettes for Blender, launch Blender 2.81,  bring up the
User Preferences window, select the Add-Ons tab, and click the &#8220;Install Add-Ons&#8221;
button. In the file selector dialog that comes up find your way to the directory
containing the <TT>gimp_palettes.py</TT> file, select it, and click the
&#8220;Install Add-On...&#8221; button. This will take you back to Blender&#8217;s
User Preferences window, where you should find that Gimp Palettes is now listed among
the available add-ons, which you can enable for the current session by ticking its
checkbox.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="BasicUsage"></A>Usage&#8212;Basic</DIV>
<P>Once the addon has been enabled for the current document, you should see an
additional &#8220;Load Palettes...&#8221; menu item appear in your Add menu
(<SPAN CLASS="key">SHIFT</SPAN>+<SPAN CLASS="key">A</SPAN>) in Object mode:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="AddLoadPalettes.png" ALT="Add menu with Load Palettes highlighted"></DIV>

<P>Selecting this menu item will bring up a standard Blender file selector, with the following
additional items at the upper right:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="LoadPalettesDefault.png" ALT="File selector with custom items"></DIV>

<P>Leave all these settings at their defaults for now, and look for a Gimp palette file to
open. If you have Gimp installed on a Linux system, you should find its standard palette
files in <TT>/usr/share/gimp/2.0/palettes/</TT>. Select any <TT>.gpl</TT> file and open it,
and when you return to your document (which might take a few seconds depending on the size
of the palette file you chose), you should see something like this:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="Swatches1.png" ALT="Simple loaded swatches"></DIV>

<P>What you see is a series of swatch objects (in this case, simple square planes),
each with its own material assigned, using one of the colours from the palette file.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="NewScene"></A>What Happened To My Model?</DIV>
<P>At this point, if you are new to Blender, you might be wondering what has happened to
the rest of the contents of your <TT>.blend</TT> file. Not to worry: Gimp Palettes puts the objects
it creates into a new scene, in order to avoid cluttering up your existing work. If you
look at the top of the Blender window, you&#8217;ll see that the scene name is now
showing &#8220;Swatches&#8221; instead of the default &#8220;Scene&#8221; (or whatever
your previous scene name was). If you select your previous scene from this menu, you will
see all your original objects reappear.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="UsingColours"></A>Now That I Have Some Colours Loaded, How Do I Use Them?</DIV>
<P>At this point, you can examine the colour swatches, and even add lights and camera
to see how they look in a full render.

<P>Once you find a colour you like, select the swatch (<SPAN CLASS="key">RMB</SPAN>) and
look in the materials tab in the Properties window to see what the name is
of the material with that colour. You can even change its name to something more memorable,
if you want.

<P>Then, switch back to one of your own scenes, and assign that same material to a suitable
object.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Unneeded"></A>Getting Rid Of Unneeded Stuff</DIV>
<P>Once you&#8217;ve assigned all the colours you want, you can delete the scene containing
the swatches, along with all the swatch objects in it. Then, when you save and reload
the <TT>.blend</TT> file, all the unused materials will disappear.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="AdvancedMaterials"></A>Customizing Material Creation</DIV>
<P>The default settings above load the colours as purely diffuse materials. But what if
you want more shiny ones, or perhaps emissive ones, or ones with subsurface scattering
(SSS) characteristics?
<P>This is easy to change. Go into Blender&#8217;s Shader Editor, select one of the
created materials, and you will see a node group called something like
&#8220;palette material common&#8221;. If you open up this node group, you
will see that it consists by default of a single diffuse shader. But it is easy
enough to replace this with some other kind of shader or mixture of shaders, and your
change will automatically affect all the created palette materials.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="CustomSwatchObjects"></A>Custom Swatch Objects</DIV>

<P>If you don&#8217;t like the colours to be shown as simple plane objects, you can
create more elaborate displays, by defining a custom swatch object. This must be a mesh,
and it must have at least one material already assigned. The object will be replicated
once for each colour, and the chosen material will be replaced with the one from the
palette entry. So parts of the object to which that material was assigned will show
the new generated material instead. Materials in other material slots will not be changed.

<P>For example, here is a scaled cube mesh with two materials assigned, one called
&#8220;Display&#8221; to the top face (to be replaced with the swatch colour)
and another called &#8220;Body&#8221; for the rest of the object:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="CustomSwatchSetup.png" ALT="Custom swatch setup"></DIV>

<P>Now, when we bring up the Gimp Palettes file selector, we can select our custom
swatch object from the &#8220;Swatch Object&#8221; popup menu, and the appropriate
material name from the &#8220;Swatch Material&#8221; menu beneath it, and when the palette
is loaded, we will see copies of our swatch object with the appropriate colours appearing
only on the parts of the objects where that material is assigned:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="CustomSwatchLoaded.png" ALT="Custom swatch in use"></DIV>

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="TooManyObjects"></A>Too Many Objects?</DIV>
<P>If you have too many objects in your document, then the popup menu for selecting
a swatch object can become too large to show in its entirety. If this happens, you can
type a search string into the &#8220;Show Only Names Matching&#8221; box, and the menu
will only show objects with names containing that search string.

<P>If you have already loaded one set of palette colours into the document, then all
the created swatches will have names derived from the swatch object you used, which can make
it difficult to select that same swatch object again; if this happens, simply give the
swatch object a new, more distinctive name before loading the new palette.
